Data
----
- WMT: The shared tasks of the yearly `Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) <http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/>`_ provide lots of parallel data
- OPUS: The OPUS project collects publicly available parallel data and provides it to everyone on their `website <http://opus.nlpl.eu/>`_.

PyTorch
=======

Here's a collection of links that should help you get started or improve your coding skills with PyTorch:

- `Intro to PyTorch <https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-to-pytorch>`_ from Udacity's Deep Learning course (Jupyter notebooks)
- `60 min Blitz tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html>`_ by Soumith Chintala
- Fast AI's `MOOC "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" <https://course.fast.ai/>`_ for a practical introduction to Deep Learning and PyTorch
