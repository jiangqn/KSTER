Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you very much for having me here today .
And now I have to present myself by myself .
My name is Christian Kromberg and I am a councilor , weird word , of the city of Essen .
These are so-called elected public officers for eight years .
And my tasks include : first , personnel , second , organization and third , public order .
Thus , I am responsible for the parking tickets in this city .
And yes , like that you don't become popular .
I know .
Furthermore , and this is something that my son especially likes , I am the head of the fire brigade .
Which means that I am the chief of the fire brigade of Essen .
Seven hundred and fifty professional fire-fighters and five hundred volunteers .
And thereby I thought about one important topic with which I want to confront you today .
It's the topic of disaster control , because also this is part of the fire brigade .
We hope for the best and prepare for the worst , that is what Jack Welch once said .
You know him .
He worked at General Electrics .
And then I start saying something a bit less serious .
I will explain a situation to you .
That is how we call it when there is a risk , when a catastrophe is imminent , for example the main station of Essen , rush hour .
