Yes , hello .
I’m happy to be here .
Yes , so , what is biohacking ?
I’ll have to provide some background information here , biohacking deals with modern molecular biology .
I study molecular biology and have been doing research into biohacking for a few years now , I started doing this because I simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what I’d learned theoretically into practice .
So these were my prime motives .
So it was curiosity and I somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
I think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology, etc.
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
There are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields .
Now there’s Craig Venter in the USA who’s trying to produce biofuel , biodiesel fuel made from algae .
And then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes .
And the list can go on forever .
And So because of my interest in the in this technology , I went delved into it more .
So what Why hacking ?
Most of us know Most people have heard of this in the context of software .
Computer hacking , and then in the media it’s Yes , hackers break into a place and steal data and so on .
That’s rather sad for the hacker community , because it doesn’t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what’s behind it .
Software hackers started building computers in the seventies and eighties and this gave rise to the Internet .
And it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way .
